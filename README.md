# OmniRobotPlatformSKIRB_RevA  
Documentation of my Omni robot platform.

The robot is designed to be modular and is based around a 3D Printed/Laser cut chassis.
This has a motor control board that connects to the battery and switch.
The motor control board has a socket that can accept different boards that are plugged in.


Different modules can be attached to the shield for control via different methods.
